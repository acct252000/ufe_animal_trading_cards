                <p>The narwhal is a medium sized tooth whale closely related to the Beluga whale.    Males are slightly larger than females.  Narwhals communicate with clicks, whistles, and knocks.  Narwhals can live up to 50 years.  They are often killed by suffocation when the sea ice freezes over. Another cause of fatality, specifically among young whales, is starvation. The current population of the narwhal is about 75,000.</p>
